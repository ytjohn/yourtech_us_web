At the beginning of this month, I said enough is enough and I forced myself back onto the slow carb diet. Slow carb is really another fancy name for low carbs, but it makes a distinction between complex and simple carbs. You also get a cheat day.


 - Rule 1: Avoid "white" carbohydrates
 - Rule 2: Eat the same few meals over and over again
 - Rule 3: Don't drink calories
 - Rule 4: Take one day off per week

I have been almost exclusively eating steak salads (from Sheetz and Ed's) and avoiding soda/sugar drinks (including diet).  I had one cheat day so far, where I got to have ice cream and tons of pasta (I had it coincide with my [Nifty Noodles and Drones Day](https://www.niftynoodlepeople.com/2017/04/09/nifty-noodles-and-drones-accomplished/)). During that day, I was surprised that I didn't gain any weight. The last time I was on this diet, I would loose a couple pounds during the week, then gain most of it back on cheat day, and average out the week with a loss of one pound.  

I know for long term weight loss, it's recommended to focus on 1lb a week, but I've been reading up on this and more and more people are agreeing that a quick drop in weight at the beginning is more motivating. After loosing 6.6lbs in 2 weeks, I have to agree.
