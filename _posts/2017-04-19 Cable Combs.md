I've been incrementally updating my home lab, and now I really wish I had a 3D printer. These cable combs look like they would be awesome for when it comes to getting the server rack re-organized.

One commenter said that the ones with a zip-tie slot will also fit nicely into a rack's square hole.  I do have a 3D printer on my "big ticket wish list" but I don't think it's in the cards for this year.
